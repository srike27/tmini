<h3> Hardware </h3>
<p> Arduino Mega based robot with xbee communication. The code flashed on to the mega is present in the src folder.
</p>
<p> A PID controller for wheel speeds has been implemented on it. </p>
<p> xbee communication can allow robot to send and recieve data over to a pc connected to a xbee base station.</p>
<p> to make modification to arduino code clone and paste motorcontrollib library to your arduino libraries folder. link: https://github.com/srike27/motorcontrollib </p>

<h3>software</h3>
